# Roots and Entities

## What Are Aggregates?

Aggregates in Remotr are logical groupings of state that work as a cohesive unit:

1. **Aggregate Root** - The entry point and controller for the entire aggregate
2. **Entities** - Individual components within the aggregate that manage specific state
3. **Transactional Boundary** - All changes across an aggregate are transactional

TODO: Create a diagram showing the relationship between an Aggregate Root and its Entities.

## Creating an Aggregate Root

Aggregate Roots are [virtual actors](../features-and-advantages/simplified-concurrency.md#understanding-aggregates-in-remotr) that:
- Act as the entry point to all operations on an aggregate
- Control all transaction boundaries
- Have no direct state of their own

### Step 1: Define the Interface

- Always empty.
- Defines how the Root is accessed.
    - TODO: List different interfaces for different types of access

```csharp
// Create your grain interface
using Remotr;

namespace MyNamespace;

// Define the Aggregate Root interface
public interface ICustomerAggregate : IAggregateRoot, IGrainWithGuidKey
{
    // The interface is always empty
    // It simply defines how the Aggregate Root is accessed
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Root

```csharp
// Implement the Aggregate Root
public class CustomerAggregate : AggregateRoot<ICustomerAggregate>, ICustomerAggregate
{
    // Define what persistent store to use
    // This references container name from your configuration (e.g. "Customer")
    public CustomerAggregate([FromKeyedServices("Customer")] IPersistentStore persistentStore) 
        : base(persistentStore)
    {
        // The constructor will always be empty
    }
}
```

### Important Notes

- **Empty Interface and Implementation**: Aggregate Roots never have methods directly on them
- **Addressing**: Roots can use any Orleans key type (Guid, string, long)
- **Entry Point**: All interactions happen through Commands and Queries

## Creating Entities

Entities are virtual actors that:
- Hold and manage state within an aggregate
- Are accessed only through their Aggregate Root
- Are co-located with their Aggregate Root

### Step 1: Define the Entity State

```csharp
// Don't forget the GenerateSerializer attribute
[GenerateSerializer]
public sealed record CustomerState
{
    // An Id property is required for Cosmos Items
    // Entities are unique by Id within an Aggregate
    [Id(0)]
    public string Id { get; set; }
    
    // Needed to differentiate partitions (depends on the Cosmos Container)
    [Id(1)]
    public Guid CustomerId { get; set; }

    // Always add the "Id" attribute to state properties
    [Id(2)]
    public string FirstName { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [Id(3)]
    public string LastName { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [Id(4)]
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [Id(5)]
    public string Address { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

### Important Rules for Entity State

- Always add the `GenerateSerializer` attribute to entity states
- States should always have a string `Id` property
- Include an additional property to identify the aggregate (e.g., `CustomerId`)
- All properties must have the `[Id(n)]` attribute (Orleans requirement)

## Commands and Queries

All operations on Aggregates happen through Commands and Queries following the CQRS pattern.

## Common Patterns

### Singleton Entity Pattern

When an Aggregate needs only one instance of a particular Entity:
<ToggledGenerationExample>
<WithGeneration>
```csharp
[UseShortcuts]
public sealed class UpdateCustomerRootCommand : RootCommandHandler<ICustomerAggregate, UpdateCustomerInfoInput, bool>
{
    public override async Task<bool> Execute(UpdateCustomerInfoInput input)
    {
        var customerId = this.GetAggregateId();
        return await CommandFactory
            .GetEntity<CustomerState>()
            .UpdateCustomerInfo(input)
            .Run("Customer"); // "Customer" is the singleton Entity ID
    }
}
```
</WithGeneration>
<WithoutGeneration>
```csharp
public sealed class UpdateCustomerRootCommand : RootCommandHandler<ICustomerAggregate, UpdateCustomerInfoInput, bool>
{
    public override async Task<bool> Execute(UpdateCustomerInfoInput input)
    {
        var customerId = this.GetAggregateId();
        return await CommandFactory
            .GetEntity<CustomerState>()
            .Tell<UpdateCustomerInfo, UpdateCustomerInfoInput, bool>(input)
            .Run("Customer"); // "Customer" is the singleton Entity ID
    }
}
```
</WithoutGeneration>
</ToggledGenerationExample>

## Concurrency Model

Aggregates provide a powerful concurrency model that balances safety and performance:

- **Commands** run sequentially and cannot interleave with other commands
- **Queries** can interleave with commands and other queries
- **Entities** can process messages concurrently within the same aggregate

TODO: Link to [Simplified Concurrency](../features-and-advantages/simplified-concurrency.md#cqrs-powered-interleaving) for more details on how aggregates process requests.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Roots Empty**: Never add methods directly to Aggregate Roots
2. **Entity Key Types**: Entity keys must always be strings
3. **No Cross-Aggregate Commands**: Never execute commands across different aggregates
4. **Size Matters**: Design aggregates to handle reasonably-sized groups of related entities
