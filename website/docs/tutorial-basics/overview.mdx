# Remotr Overview 

<OverviewAnimation />

The animation above shows the domain model of Remotr, a system built around three core aggregates:

- **Customer Aggregate**: Handles user profiles, purchase history, and wish lists
- **Store Aggregate**: Manages inventory, billing, and purchase records
- **Order Aggregate**: Processes orders, items, and payments

Each aggregate has a root entity (shown in green) and multiple related entities (shown in black).
