# Instructions for creating a new step
1. When creating a new step, never forget to add the transition animation to go back to the previous step. For example, going from step 1 to step 2 will change elements that should have a reverse animation for going from step 2 to step 1 via the back button
2. Create new Step{N-1}To{N}Transition.ts file in transitions directory: website/src/components/Animation/transitions where N is the step
3. Implement the Transition interface found in [types.ts](mdc:website/src/components/Animation/transitions/types.ts)
4. Use anime.js for animations:
- Duration: TRANSITION_DURATION (300ms)
- Wrap in Promise
- Handle skipAnimation by setting duration to 0
5. Add transition to TRANSITIONS array in [TransitionManager.ts](mdc:website/src/components/Animation/transitions/TransitionManager.ts)
6. Implement cleanup if animations persist between transitions
7. Ensure all animations resolve their promises on completion

Look at [Step3To4Transition.ts](mdc:website/src/components/Animation/transitions/Step3To4Transition.ts) as an example.

# Instructions for modifying an existing step
- You can find the specified step file by looking for Step{N-1}To{N}Transition.ts file in transitions directory: website/src/components/Animation/transitions where N is the step number
- When adding more animations to an existing step, never forget to add the transition animation to go back to the previous step. For example, going from step 1 to step 2 will change elements that should have a reverse animation for going from step 2 to step 1 via the back button
